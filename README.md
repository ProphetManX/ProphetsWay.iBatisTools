# ProphetsWay.iBatisTools
A small library that will help with using iBatisNet as your DAL

In my testing I have found that I can't get iBatisNet to work in Net Core Test application, so I have the iBatisTools project
only building in Net Framework setups for now.  If anyone can get me a version of iBatisNet that I can use in both Net Framework
and Net Core, I will be absolutely happy to upgrade this to support them both as well.


## How to use
You can reference iBatisTools from NuGet.  Once you have it in your project, you will be able to write custom implementations
for your DAL, however some functionality will be handled for you in base abstract classes that you can inherit from.  I will
try to explain each of the base classes in order of how I would probably code a new project from scratch.

For examples, please see the example projects included in the GitHub repository.

## Base Dao Classes
##### Special note
iBatisTools references interfaces that were established in another project, ProphetsWay.BaseDataAccess.  The point of mentioning
this is that you will need to follow the guidelines for the DAO interfaces defined within that project 
(but only to make use of the BaseDao classes).


### BaseDao
This Dao implements the IBaseDao interface, meaning it has all the CRUD calls established within.  It is built around a specific
naming convention to be used within your SqlMap.xml files.  The following methods are implemented:

``` c#
T Get(T item);
void Insert(T item);
int Update(T item);
int Delete(T item);
```

To make use of these methods, you must set the namespace in your SqlMap.xml files to be the literal name of the entity it is for.
For example, if you have a POCO named ```Company``` then in your SqlMap.xml you need ```namespace="Company"```.  Then 
you will need to have four specifically named queries created.

``` xml
<select id="Get[EntityName]ById" parameterClass="[Namespace].[EntityName]" />
<insert id="Insert[EntityName]" parameterClass="[Namespace].[EntityName]" />
<update id="Update[EntityName]" parameterClass="[Namespace].[EntityName]" />
<update id="Delete[EntityName]ById" parameterClass="[Namespace].[EntityName]" />
```
When setup as per the previous example entity ```Company```
``` xml
<select id="GetCompanyById" parameterClass="ProphetsWay.iBatisTools.Ex.DataAccess.Entities.Company" />
<insert id="InsertCompany" parameterClass="ProphetsWay.iBatisTools.Ex.DataAccess.Entities.Company" />
<update id="UpdateCompany" parameterClass="ProphetsWay.iBatisTools.Ex.DataAccess.Entities.Company" />
<update id="DeleteCompanyById" parameterClass="ProphetsWay.iBatisTools.Ex.DataAccess.Entities.Company" />
```

You will still need to manually write the queries however you want, but you will get the whole entity as your parameter object.
In the case for ```Get``` and ```Delete``` you only need the Id property to be set on the object, but the variable is still
the object.

### BaseGetAllDao
This Dao inherits from BaseDao and implements the IBaseGetAllDao interface.  The following method is implemented:
``` c#
IList<T> GetAll(T item);
```

Since this inherits from BaseDao, the naming convention of the SqlMap.xml is still required for the CRUD calls.  The new
query you will need to add is:
``` xml
<select id="GetAll" />
```

Unlike the methods for BaseDao, ```GetAll``` doesn't require the entity name to be part of the query name.  It also does 
not require any parameter since the point is to return all of the entity from the database.

### BasePagedDao
This Dao inherits from BaseDao and implements the IBasePagedDao interface.  The following methods are implemented:

``` c#
int GetCount(T item);
IList<T> GetPaged(T item, int skip, int take);
```

Just like above, naming convention for the namespace is required in the SqlMap.xml.  The new queries needed are:

``` xml
<select id="GetCount" resultClass="int" />
<select id="GetPaged" parameterClass="map" />
```

With ```GetCount``` no parameters are required, and the point for this is to provide an upper limit for your UI to get quickly
when rendering a paging control.  Then the ```GetPaged``` method has a ```"map"``` as it's parameter.  The two values in the
map are ```#Offset#``` and ```#PageSize#``` and you should use them in your queries.  For the ```Company``` example 
from above:

``` xml
<select id="GetPaged" parameterClass="map" resultMap="CompanyMap">
	SELECT *
	FROM dbo.Companies
	OFFSET #Offset#
	ROWS FETCH NEXT #PageSize# ROWS ONLY
</select>
```

## EnumTypeHandlers
Sometimes in your entities you use objects to reference a value from a drop down, maybe it's a string literal, and other times
you want to use an ```enum``` object value.  In order to use these with iBatis you have to use a ```TypeHandler``` class that 
implements ```ITypeHandlerCallback```.  In iBatisTools there are two options that have been setup for you to choose from:
```EnumTypeAsIntHandler<T>``` and ```EnumTypeAsStringHandler<T>```.  You will need to create a new class type handler
to work with your specific class objects, however you only need to inherit one of those two classes, and specify your class
as the generic value for T.  For example, I have the following enum and type handler created:

``` c#
//roles as an enum is defined within my DataAccess project along with all my entity models
public enum Roles
{
    Admin,
    User,
    Developer
}

//RoleHandler is defined within my iBatis DAL project 
public class RoleHandler : EnumTypeAsIntHandler<Roles>    {    } 
```

The difference between ```AsInt``` and ```AsString``` refer to how the value is stored in the database.  ```AsInt``` will store
the integer value of the enum in your database, so you would likely need to create a reference table for those values to map to
for database sanity checks and queries.  Since integers are likely a smaller footprint than strings, usually this is the 
preferred implementation.  However sometimes you just want the string value of the enum stored in the database, so basic queries
can quickly inform what the value represents, for that you need to use the ```AsString``` version.


## MapperFactory
Lastly to talk about is the ```MapperFactory``` class.  This is what will construct the mapper you use for your Daos.  All the
base Dao classes require a mapper argument when they're constructed.  I always felt like this part was annoying since it is 
where the actual validation for your SqlMap.xml and SqlMap.config files are actually validated.  This now has some logging
embedded within it so you can quickly identify what is blowing up your code if/when you make map changes.

The one major requirement for using the ```MapperFactory``` is that you name your SqlMap.config file as follows:  
"SqlMap.[whatever naming you prefer].config" and the file must be set as an embedded resource within your project.  The code
will use a referenced assembly to find the config file, and then depending on how the config file is setup, it will find all
the SqlMap.xml files and load them.  There are three options to generate a mapper, one takes no arguments and assumes the 
connection string information is wholly contained within the config file, a second option takes a full connection string 
to be used, and the third option takes a ```NameValueCollection``` as a parameter so you can specify what variables/values
you want to pass in and use within your config file.

Examples:
``` xml
<!-- complete connection information -->
<database>
    <provider name="sqlServer2008"/>
    <dataSource name="ProphetsWay.iBatisTools.Ex.Database" connectionString="Initial Catalog=ProphetsWay.iBatisTools.Ex.Database;Data Source=localhost;Integrated Security=True;Persist Security Info=False;Pooling=False;MultipleActiveResultSets=False;Connect Timeout=60;Encrypt=False;TrustServerCertificate=False"/>
</database>

<!-- whole connection string replacement -->
<database>
    <provider name="sqlServer2008"/>
    <dataSource name="ProphetsWay.iBatisTools.Ex.Database" connectionString="${connectionString}"/>
</database>

<!-- specific value/variable replacement -->
<database>
    <provider name="sqlServer2008"/>
    <dataSource name="ProphetsWay.iBatisTools.Ex.Database" connectionString="Initial Catalog=ProphetsWay.iBatisTools.Ex.Database;Data Source=localhost;user id=${username};password=${password};Connection Timeout=60;Max Pool Size=1000"/>
</database>
```

You can see the replacement values use the syntax of ```${variableName}```, the connection string option was setup so you 
don't have to know the variable to replace, it is handled for you.  However if you prefer to keep the details for a connection
in separate places, you can use many different variables and pass all the values in to build the connection (or really any part
of the config file).

Lastly is an example of how you'd invoke each of those examples above.
``` c#
public ExDataAccessTake1()
{
    _mapper = GetType().Assembly.GenerateMapper();
    _companyDao = new CompanyDao(_mapper);
    _jobDao = new JobDao(_mapper);
    _userDao = new UserDao(_mapper);
}

public ExDataAccessTake2(string connString)
{
    _mapper = GetType().Assembly.GenerateMapper(connString);
    _companyDao = new CompanyDao(_mapper);
    _jobDao = new JobDao(_mapper);
    _userDao = new UserDao(_mapper);
}

public ExDataAccessTake3(string userName, string userPass)
{
    //I recommend creating the name value collection within this project
    //so that you can verify the "keys" match the variables used within your
    //SqlMap.config file.
    //If you choose to use more/many/different variables, just make sure
    //you require them in your constructor here, and pass them all into your 
    //NameValueCollection before calling GenerateMapper.
    var coll = new NameValueCollection();
    coll.Add("username", userName);
    coll.Add("password", userPass);

    _mapper = GetType().Assembly.GenerateMapper(coll);
    _companyDao = new CompanyDao(_mapper);
    _jobDao = new JobDao(_mapper);
    _userDao = new UserDao(_mapper);
}
```

You can see that all the code referenced is in the constructor of the main DataAccess implementation file.  In here all the 
specific Dao's are also created so that they share the same mapper object/connection to the database.  This will allow you 
to structure some calls using a transaction and then work across multiple tables/Daos and commit or rollback depending 
on how things play out for you.  If you were to give each Dao their own mapper instance, then this functionality would not
be possible.

For working examples of how all these parts work, please see the example projects within the GitHub repository.



## Running the tests

The library has 9 unit tests currently.  I only covered code that exercises the iBatisTools functionality.
They are created with an XUnit test project, as well as Example projects with differing iBatis SqlMap.config setups.
Unfortunately I don't have the unit tests running in the build pipeline because they are actually
hitting my local database to run.
